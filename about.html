  Hi, this is Fuxin, a New York-based product designer. I have about 3 years of professional experience. My work routine includes user research, user experience design, wireframing, rapid prototyping, user interface design, testing, and iteration. <br><br>
  I held an MFA degree in Design & Technology from Parsons School of Design and a Bachelor's Degree in Thermal Energy and Power Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University. As a designer, my multi-disciplinary education experience allows me to have both engineering thinking and design thinking. Thus, I can better communicate with the engineers, product managers, and stakeholders in the team and understand their ideas. <br><br>Besides work, I have a very broad of interests, which include working out, hiking, baking, and handcrafting.<br><br>

<div> As a designer with an engineering background, I prefer the pragmatic design in my daily work. In my opinion, the fundamental purpose of design is to solve problems. Only on this basis can creativity, visuals, and interaction be considered.</div><br>

<b>Information > Form</b>
<br><br><div>A good design should be able to express the designer's intentions and convey their ideas. It can be a real product, but it must be more than a product. The more important value of design is to communicate with developers, product managers, and other stakeholders. In the early stages of design, simple wireframes, or even hand-drawn sketches, are more suitable for communication than complete design solutions, which also can increase the speed and efficiency of designer testing and iteration. At this stage, a perfect design solution will, on the contrary, limit the iteration of the product, making it more difficult for people to discover problems. The efforts to complete the design solution will also become resistant to product iteration.</div><br>

<div>If a sketch can clearly convey the designer's intentions, then there is no need to use wireframes or low-fidelity interfaces; if simple annotations can show the way of interaction, then do not spend time making interaction videos. The energy of the design team is limited, and designers should focus on more important things.</div><br>
<div>Furthermore, design is a means of communicating with users. If an app has excellent vision and perfect interaction, but the interface flow is contrary to the users' behaviors; a product has great creativity, but the user cannot obtain and understand the designer's ideas, no matter which is obviously not a designer wants to see. Good design should make the users clear at a glance and minimize the user’s learning process.</div><br>

<b>Improvement > Creation</b>
<br><br><div>A good design does not need to be a completely new idea, but can be an improvement based on an existing experience. Some designers think that if they want to do a good design, they must have a fresh idea, which often leads the design astray and separates it from real life. From my perspective, a good design can be an improvement and optimization based on the existing form. For example, the development of short video platforms: designers did not invent a new media form to replace video, but compared to traditional video platforms, they shortened the duration and changing the layout from horizontal to vertical, which made it more suitable for the scenario of smartphones, convenient for users to browse on their mobile devices.</div><br>
<div>The purpose of product design is to solve the difficulties encountered by users in the existing scenario and achieve the purpose of comprehensively improving and optimizing the user experience, rather than simply creating a brand new product.</div><br>

<b>Funcationality > Artistry</b>
<br><br><div>American designer Charles Eames once said that design is "an expression of purpose. It may, if it is good enough, later be judged as art". When designing a product, we must make it clear that it is designed for users, not just the expression of the designer's personal ideas. Even products with the same function, when designed for different target users, the outcomes may be the opposite.</div><br>
<div>For example, when designing for middle-aged and senior people, factors such as high learning costs, weakened physical strength, and visual loss should be taken into account. When designing interfaces for this group of users, larger fonts, simpler interaction, more vivid colors, and larger effective interaction area are supposed to be considered. These may reduce the visual effect of the product, but it will make the user experience smoother and more natural. When the functionality of the design conflicts with the artistry, designers should consider which can optimize the user's experience, and then make a choice.</div><br>

<b>Outcome > Process</b>
<br><br><div>Design is result-oriented, not process-oriented. What the designer shows to the user is the final design result, not the previous design process. As designers, we should not blindly complete the design according to the existing process but should adjust the design process at any time according to the actual situation. Not every design needs to use all the user research methods and design methods to complete. According to the target users and design intent, selecting reasonable methods can better improve the design efficiency.</div>
<div>The mistake that designers often make is that they spend a lot of time and energy on user research in the early stages, but the outcome does not match the research results; or put a lot of effort into designing interaction methods and animations without considering technical feasibility so that developers can not achieve the expected results. Therefore, when we are doing design, we should pay more attention to whether the design can achieve the function, rather than whether the design process is as complete as what we learned in school.</div><br><br>
<br>

<div>In summary, I think a good design needs to pay more attention to its information transmission, optimization effect, functionality, and outcomes. Based on this, an excellent designer needs to be good at expression and communication, have a clear logic, decisive, and extensively involved. Besides, they also need to continuously learn new skills and understand the changes in user preferences.</div>
